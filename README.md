# R + Python Binder Example

Demos for OU R-Club tutorial

*This repo builds on the [`r_with_python`](https://github.com/binder-examples/r_with_python) repo and provides examples of using both R and Python in both Jupyter notebooks and RStudio.*

 - Launch in Jupyter Notebooks: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ouseful-demos/ou-rclub/master)
 - Launch in RStudio: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ouseful-demos/ou-rclub/master?urlpath=rstudio)

Example files are in the `tutorial` directory.

*I also reminded myself of a range of topic based notebook examples I'd developed previously on the soon to be shut down `notebooks.azure.com` service. I've moved the notebooks to [`ouseful-demos/getting-started-with-notebooks`](https://github.com/ouseful-demos/getting-started-with-notebooks) and will try to pull a binder config that allows them to run as an when I get a chance.*
